  <!-- Research Notes -->

  <!-- some() method - tests if at least one element in the array passes the
   condition implemented by the provided function. It returns true if it finds
   an element, in the array,for which the provided function returns true. Some() 
   immediately returns true and stop iterating through the array. It doesn't modify 
   the array, but the function provided as callbackFn can. -->

  <!-- every() method - tests if all elements in the array passes the condition
   implemented by the provided function. It returns a boolean value. If an element
   doesn't pass, it returns false and stop iterating through the array.  -->


  <!-- find() method - returns the first element in the provided array that
   satisfies the provided testing function. If no value satisfy the testing
   function, undefined is returned. It calls a provided callbackFn function
   once for each element in an array in ascending-index order, until the function
   returns true, find() then returns that element and stop iterating through the
   array.
   
   if you need the index of the found element, use findIndex()

   if you need to find the index of a value, use indexOf(). it's similar to
   findIndex(), but checks each element for equality with the value instead of
   the testing function.

   if you need to find if a value exists within an array, use includes().checks each 
   element for equality with the value instead of the testing function. -->

  <!-- findIndex() method - returns the index of the first element in an array that
   satisfies the provided testing function. If no elements satisfy the provided
   function, -1 is returned. Like find(), It calls a provided callbackFn function
   once for each element in an array in ascending-index order, until the function
   returns true, findIndex() then returns that element and stop iterating through the
   array. -->
